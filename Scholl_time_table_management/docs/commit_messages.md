# Commit Message Standards

Follow Conventional Commits style (lightweight):

- Format: `<type>(scope?): subject`
- Examples:
  - `feat(api): add timetable POST endpoint`
  - `fix(db): handle missing connection error`
  - `docs: update roadmap and error budget`

Keep subject under 72 characters. Use present tense and be descriptive.
