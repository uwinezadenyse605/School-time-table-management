# PR & Code Review Guidelines

- Open a PR from `feature/*` into `develop`.
- Include a short description, testing steps, and any migration notes.
- Assign reviewers and request at least one approval.
- CI must pass before merge.
- Use small, focused PRs (<200 lines preferred).

Checklist for reviewers:
- Code matches style and patterns of repo.
- No obvious performance or security issues (no secrets in code).
- Tests added or updated for new behavior.
